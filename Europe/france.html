        <h1>France</h1>
        <p></p>France in the middle of one of its hottest summers on record when we visited</br>
         We spent time at the beach in Normandy as well as enjoying plenty of shaded cafes!</p>

         <h2>Mont St Michel</h2>

         <p>This famous old monastery is situated on an island and stands out prominently for miles around.
         Narrow streets and thousands of tourists made for an overwhelming visit.</p>
       
         <h2>Louvre Museum</h2>

         <p>Our dose of culture on the trip. We spent hours roaming up and down the seemingless endless halls of art.</p>
       
         <h2>Eiffel Tower, Paris</h2>
         <img src = "C:\Users\maxba\OneDrive - St Andrews College\11 Digitech\2023-year-11-web-design-classwork-mba9907\Europe\images\eiffel.jpg" alt = "Eiffel Tower" />

         <p>We kept coming back to the Eiffel Tower, enjoying just hanging out in the park around its base.</br>

            We also enjoyed going to the top of the tower and the incredible view of Paris, not to mention eating delicious ice cream while up there. </p>
